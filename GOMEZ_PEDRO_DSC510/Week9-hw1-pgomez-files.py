# Course: DSC510-T303 Introduction to Programming (2201-1)
#   Desc: Open the file and process each line; open new file for output
#
# Usage: Open the file and process each line.
# Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
# Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency. You should use string formatting for this. (See discussion 8.3).
# We want to achieve each major goal with a function (one function, one action). We can find four functions that need to be created.
#
# add_word: Add each word to the dictionary. Parameters are the word and a dictionary. No return value.
#
# Process_line: There is some work to be done to process the line: strip off various characters,
# split out the words, and so on. Parameters are a line and the dictionary.
# It calls the function add word with each processed word. No return value.
#
# Create a new function called process_fie. This function will perform the same operations as pretty_print from week 8 however it will print to a file instead of to the screen.
# Modify your main method to print the length of the dictionary to the file as opposed to the screen.
# This will require that you open the file twice. Once in main and once in process_file.
# Prompt the user for the filename they wish to use to generate the report.
# Use the filename specified by the user to write the file.
# This will require you to pass the file as an additional parameter to your new process_file function.
#
#
# main: We will use a main function as the main program. As usual, it will open the file
# and call process_line on each line. When finished, it will call pretty_print to print
# the dictionary.
#
# In the main function, you will need to open the file. We will cover more regarding opening
# of files next week but I wanted to provide you with the block of code you will utilize to
# open the file, see below.
